## 👋 About Me

🎓 **Hi, I’m @samial123 (Sami Olivier Al-Najjar)**  
I’m passionate about exploring the world of **big tech** and currently learning **Python** with plans to start **C++** soon. While I’m not yet collaborating on projects, I’m building a solid foundation in programming and developing skills for future endeavors.  

🎻 Outside of coding, I’ve been playing the **violin** for many years. It’s one of my favorite creative outlets. Feel free to reach out via my school email at **[sa454123@ohio.edu](mailto:sa454123@ohio.edu)**.  

🌍 I’m an undergraduate student at **Ohio University**, focused on honing my skills and exploring the intersection of technology and creativity.
